## Simple transformer 

Written in PyTorch, it consists of two primary components: the Transformer Encoder and Transformer Decoder; incorporating them into a full Transformer model. 

advanced elements like positional encoding or multi-head attention are emitted for the sake of simplicity.

### Simple Transformer 

**k**: dimensionality of the input (which should also be the dimensionality of the model)
**depth**: the number of layers in both the encoder and decoder
**num_classes**: the number of classes for classification tasks.

This also needs additional positional encoding, padding, and other factors to build a fully functional transformer model.Intended to give you a basic understanding of the architecture.
